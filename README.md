# How I held my breath for 17 minutes

## Introduction

> The goal of all our discussions is to explore the question of what’s possible for your life.  Can we expand who we believe we can become and expand the scope of what we expect of ourselves.  This is hands down my favorite TED talk.  Even if you think his “stunts” are silly, David Blane is committed to testing what’s possible for a human being to accomplish.  Furthermore he does it in service to others to liberate them from their limited ideas of what they can achieve.  I’d like you to reflect on what limiting beliefs are present in your life, and what it would take for you to let those go. Please write a blog post with your reaction to this.  Tomorrow around 3pm we’ll break into two groups again to talk about it. - Blake
